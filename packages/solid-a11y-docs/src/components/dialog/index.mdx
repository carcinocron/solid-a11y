## Labeling

`<Dialog />` has built-in support for the `<Label />` (title of the modal) and `<Description />`
components. Instead of `<Label />`, one may use `<DialogTitle />` which uses a default tag of `h1`,
but is otherwise identical to `<Label />`. `h1` is often the desired heading tag for a dialog's
content.

## Focus Management

It a good practice to ensure that a dialog contains at least one focusable element, such as a button
to dismiss the dialog. By default, `<Dialog />` will automatically focus the first focusable element
in the dialog's content. In addition, focus will be "trapped" within the dialog's content, so that
`Tab`/`Shift+Tab` will round-robin through only the dialog's focusable elements.

The `initialFocusRef` prop enables overriding this default behavior when the first focusable element
is not appropriate for initial focus, such as when the first element is a button confirming a
"destructive" action. One should initially focus a "more conservative" action, such as a cancel
button, to safeguard against accidental double key-presses causing irreversible consequences.
