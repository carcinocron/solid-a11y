# {COMPONENTS.dialog.title}

A dialog (or "modal") component with keyboard support, focus management, scroll locking, and more.

## Some Notes on Labeling

Like many other accessibility concerns, its considered good practice to add ARIA aware labels to
your dialog so that users understand what it is for. This commponent has built in support for the
`<Label />` (title of the modal) and `<Description />` (additional context and information)
components. Instead of `<Label />`, one may use the `<DialogTitle />` which uses a better default
tag of `h1` but is otherwise identical to `<Label />`.

## Focus Management

It is a good idea to ensure that dialogs have at least one focusable element contained within them
(for instance, at the very least a button to dismiss the dialog). By default, `<Dialog />` will
focus the first item within the dialog and also "trap" focus within the dialog meaning that
`Tab`/`Shift+Tab` will round robin within the dialog's focusable elements.

It may also be desirable to override this default behavior with an element that makes more sense. Be
sure to make this element the more conservative or less destructive action so that accidental
keypresses do not disturb the user. For instance, in a confirmation modal, it makes sense to focus
the "cancelling" button rather than the "affirmative" button.
