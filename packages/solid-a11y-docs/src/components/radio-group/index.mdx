# {COMPONENTS["radio-group"].title}

Radio Groups are an alternative to native `<input type="radio" />`, or a set of checkable buttons,
known as radio buttons, where no more than one of the buttons can be checked at a time.

## Labeling

Both `<RadioGroup />` and `<RadioGroupOption />` have built in support for `<Label />` and
`<Description />`, allowing one to add desired annotations and descriptions to the either the group
as a whole or to the individual options.

## Active (Focused) and Checked Conditionals

Like all `solid-a11y` components, Radio Groups are completely unstyled but do offer an API to
condtionally style and control the checked and focused (active) elements.

For conditional classes, use the function API on `classList` with `checked` and `active` signal
render props. For conditinal content/children, use the `checked` and `active` signal render props.
