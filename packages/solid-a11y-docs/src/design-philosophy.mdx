# Design Philosophy

`solid-a11y` is a small and nimble foundation to a [SolidJS][solid_js] web app and design system.
Components aim to be fully accessible for keyboard and screen reader users by adding appropriate
event handlers and `aria-*` DOM attributes. It also encourages best practices for accessiblity with
its API, documentation, and conveniences. `solid-a11y` was developed because the web, including
highly interactive content that uses Solid, should be available to everyone.

As opposed to other component libraries, `solid-a11y` comes without any styles or CSS. It therefore
enables full control and responsibility over visuals to the developer and designer. It pairs
perfectly with virtually any CSS framework because styling is done through plain `class`,
`classList`, and `style` props. [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss] is used throughout the documention for
example code, but it is not necessary.

Moreover, `solid-a11y` aims for simple and tractable APIs, comprehensive documentation, and
enjoyable developer experience. It ships with TypeScript defintions and has no NPM dependencies
other than its peer dependency on Solid. It is tree-shakeable so that features may be adopted
piecewise without the overhead of extra bundle bytes.

## Thanks and Appreciations

Much of this library is inspired by the excellent [headless-ui][headless_ui], though some API
changes to match Solid idioms are in place, and `solid-a11y` does not aim to be a drop-in
replacement.
