# Design Philosophy

`solid-a11y` is meant to serve as a small and nimble foundation to a [SolidJS][solid_js] web app and
design system. It aims to be fully accessible for keyboard and screen reader users by handling
callbacks and `aria-*` DOM attributes automatically for the developer. It also attempts to encourage
accessibility best practices with its API, documentation, and conveniences. If one chooses to use
`solid-a11y`, it is because they believe the web should be available to everyone, even when their
content is highly interactive and uses Solid.

As opposed to other component libraries, `solid-a11y` comes with absolutely no styles or CSS.
Because of this choice, it enables full control and responsibility of visuals to the developer and
designer. It pairs perfectly with virtually any CSS framework because styling is done through plain
`class`, `classList`, and `style` props. Example code in the documentation uses the popular
[Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss], but this is not a necessitated choice.

`solid-a11y` moreover aims for simple and tractable APIs, comprehensive and fun documentation, and
solid and good developer experience. It ships with TypeScript defintions and has _zero_ NPM
dependencies, if you don't count its peer dependency on Solid. It should be tree-shakeable so that
one only pays piecewise in bundle bytes.

## Thanks and Appreciations

Much of this library is inspired by the excellent [headless-ui][headless_ui], though some API
changes to match Solid idioms are in place, and `solid-a11y` is not aiming to be a drop-in
replacement.
